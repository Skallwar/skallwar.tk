      <description>A word on signals If you have already played with signals, chances are you might have tried to catch signals using the signal or sigaction syscalls. All signals can be caught except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.
 The SIGKILL signal is used to cause immediate program termination. It cannot be handled or ignored, and is therefore always fatal. It is also not possible to block this signal. [&amp;hellip;] if SIGKILL fails to terminate a process, that by itself constitutes an operating system bug which you should report.</description>
